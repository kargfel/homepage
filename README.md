## 📖 About

This is my personal corner of the internet. I am an **Informatics Student at DHBW Stuttgart** with a strong interest in Computer Science and **Cybersecurity**. 

This website serves as a hub to showcase my projects, skills, and contact information. It is designed to be accessible, fast, and easy on the eyes (thanks to Dark Mode).

## ✨ Key Features

* **🌗 Dark/Light Mode:** * Automatically detects system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`).
    * Persists user choice via `localStorage`.
    * Smooth visual toggle with custom icons.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** * Mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS breakpoints.
    * Adapts layout from single-column (mobile) to multi-column (desktop).
* **🎨 Dynamic Project Cards:** * Supports standard image thumbnails.
    * **Live Component Preview:** Capable of rendering live React components (animations/previews) inside project cards instead of static images (e.g., `ShitbingoPreview`).
* **⚡ Tech Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS.
